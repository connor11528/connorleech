Great personal development article :)

“It is easy to get bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for change: the fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build muscle, the perfect idea for a side hustle. We are so focused on figuring out the best approach that we never get around to taking action” 

- James Clear, Atomic Habits


great is just good, but repeatable.
