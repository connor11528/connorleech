Heart Disease is the number one killer in America. Americans are more likely to die from heart disease than any other cause. On average, 650,000+ Americans die from heart disease every year, eclipsing even the half million that passed from covid. It's scary shit. The good news that there are things we can do about it to improve our health and our society.

- Heart disease as a cause of death didn't exist in rural parts of China and Uganda. Dying from heart disease is a recent phenomenon that's a result of our concentrated, industrialized food systems. 
- Low cholesterol levels help prevent heart disease.
- Plant based diets are high in fiber and low in saturated and trans fats that clog our arteries.
- Plant based diet is a lot healthier and more effective than taking prescription pills to mitigate disease.

I've only scratched the surface of "How Not to Die" by Michael Greger, MD. I'm scheduled for a blood test this week. Thanks [WellnessFX](https://www.wellnessfx.com/) :)
