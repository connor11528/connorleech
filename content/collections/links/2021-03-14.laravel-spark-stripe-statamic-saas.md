Really powerful tech stack for building SaaS applications. The new [Laravel Spark](https://spark.laravel.com/), [Statamic 3](https://statamic.com/) and [Paddle](https://paddle.com/) combined with something like [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/components) for styling. These are all best in class tools to handle building out various aspects of a modern web app. Can't wait to build something amazing with these tools. Been working on integrating Tailwind UI and Statamic into [Employbl](https://www.employbl.com/). Would like to set up a new Laravel Spark application with Paddle for payment processing, maybe once this job hunt is over and my three year old is in daycare ðŸ¤£ My wife and I have the idea, some design mockups and a landing page for [Brand Connect](https://www.brandconnect.us/). Just need to get started building the app with all these amazing tools.
