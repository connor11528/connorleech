This handy website darkpatterns.org gives insights into all the shady UX tricks and shady shit that internet companies can do to decieve people and make money. I remember when Facebook used to be more private than it's competitor MySpace. MySpace was all over the place where Facebook pre-newsfeed required a college email address and to see info about people you had to go and look on their wall (profile). When the newsfeed got introduced people's actions were broadcast all over the site. To this day Facebook and Instagram are publishers through what they feed people. The "data brokering" industry is new to me. The infographic above is from 2015.
