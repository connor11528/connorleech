This article from linkedin influencer Daniel Goleman outlines advice for job seekers. These are my takeaways:

- **Emotional balance** is essential for the job hunt. Remove yourself from your thoughts, practice mindfulness and let thoughts come and go without attaching yourself to them. Stay cool headed when others might panic.

- **Resilience** is being able to bounce back from setbacks. Stay focused on your goal: getting your next job. The faster you get back to calm after you get upset is one measure of how resilient you are.

- **Keep going**. The ability to keep going despite rejection and disappointments is crucial. Every "no" gets you closer to the next "yes". It's a numbers game. Keep your attitude!
