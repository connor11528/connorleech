> Diffbot, alongside Google and Microsoft, is one of only three US companies that crawl the entire public web. Diffbot crawls the web nonstop and rebuilds its knowledge graph every four to five days.

> The search engine DuckDuckGo uses Diffbot to generate its own Google-like boxes. Snapchat uses it to extract highlights from news pages. The popular wedding-planner app Zola uses it to help people make wedding lists, pulling in images and prices. NASDAQ, which provides information about the stock market, uses it for financial research.
