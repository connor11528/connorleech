I recently posted a link about [how not to die from a heart attack](https://connorleech.info/links/book-recommendation-how-not-to-die). This is a study from Harvard about how meditation is good for the body, including the heart and blood flow.

With varying success I use Todoist to try and remind myself to meditate for 10 mins daily. There are also other apps to help like Headspace and Calm et al. Take the time to meditate it could help save your life :)
