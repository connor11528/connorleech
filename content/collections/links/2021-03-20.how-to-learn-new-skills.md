Josh Kaufman wrote a book _Personal MBA: Master the Art of Business_ and gave a TEDx talk titled "The first 20 hours -- how to learn anything". Watch the YouTube video by clicking button below..

These are my main takeaways:

- **Deconstruct the skill:** decide exactly what you want to be able to do. Break the skill down into smaller and smaller pieces. Learn the most important pieces first.
- **Self correct:** Learn enough so you can self correct or self edit while practicing the skill. This is so you can notice when you make a mistake.
- **Remove distractions:** Remove barriers and distractions that would inhibit practicing. Make it easy to practice the skill.
- **20 hours:** Practice the skill for 20 hours.
