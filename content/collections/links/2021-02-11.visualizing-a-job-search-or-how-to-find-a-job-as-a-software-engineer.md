Very interesting and detailed article about how tech hiring works and how to stay organized in your job hunt!

> "This post covers the process that I used, some observations of trying to find a job in San Francisco within the startup ecosystem, the pros and cons of technical interview process, and lastly how I made my choice."

> "In total, I communicated with 23 different companies to receive 4 offers to make a single choice. During the process, I was rejected 9 times with the remaining conversations fizzling or being cut off by myself."

- Time is the number one enemy of both the candidate and the employer.
- Organization is key, and keeping all companies at roughly the same stage is difficult.
- Technical interviews are imperfect, but the best tool weâ€™ve got to determine technical know-how of widely different skillsets.
- Companies ghost on candidates all the time. Rather than cleanly tying up communication, some companies just drift into the ether. (For my purposes, I read this as hard pass.)
