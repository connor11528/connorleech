Interesting take to "start with when". From the article:

I believe that there are three opportune times to join a startup:

- As early as possible (or as you can stomach).
- When the train has already left the station.
- When there is a truly unique ability to learn, collaborate with specific people, or work in a special situation.

They also have a [PDF guide](/assets/How-to-Find-the-Perfect-Startup-Job.pdf) on evaluating startups and opportunities :)
