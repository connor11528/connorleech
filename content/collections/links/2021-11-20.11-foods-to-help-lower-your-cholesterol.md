I've been blood tested and have high cholesterol a few times so I take medication for it. I also exercise four times a week, walk about 9,000 steps a day and eat pretty healthy. Now that I'm over 30 and have two kids I want to live forever so definitely prioritizing my health. I consult this list of foods that raise good cholesterol and lower bad cholesterol when shopping or prepping meals. If you're overweight or have high cholesterol and are looking for resources I've found WellnessFX great for ordering blood tests, [Thistle](https://www.thistle.co/?referral_key=CONNORM6CR) fantastic for helping me eat healthy lunches and an Equinox membership supportive of getting my butt to the gym. Hope you find these links useful too.
