"We hope to work with you to extend targeted, meaningful coronavirus relief for families and
businesses, protect Americans with pre-existing conditions, strengthen and modernize our
infrastructure, enforce our antitrust laws against emboldened technology monopolies, and restore
our economy struggling in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic.
We firmly believe that what unites us as Americans is far greater than anything that may ever
divide us. In that spirit, we hope that we can rise above the partisan fray to negotiate meaningful
change for Americans across the nation and maintain the United Statesâ€™ standing as the best
country in the world."
