SwiftUI is a relatively new tool to help in building apps for Apple's ecosystem. This looks like an interesting course on how to design and build real apps with minimal coding.

> SwiftUI is hands-down the best way for designers to take a first step into code. Thanks to its live Preview, you can iterate quickly and create powerful user interfaces with a few lines of code that works for all of Apple's platforms. Take your static design to the next level and build real apps with the simplicity of a prototyping tool.

> We're using Sketch to design the interface and Shape for the illustrations. All design and source files are provided so that you can upgrade your UI skills while following the lessons.
