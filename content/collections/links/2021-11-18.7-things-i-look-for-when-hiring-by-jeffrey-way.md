Great notes from the developer and educator extraordinaire, founder of Laracasts on what he looks for when making a new hire.

Good things to consider for job seekers. It's one man's opinion but I found the article helpful, especially when I was let go from my previous company. This is a high level overview of top level advice for job applicants by an "indie" founder. Laracasts is great too if you're interested in learning Laravel, Vue, Inertia etc.
