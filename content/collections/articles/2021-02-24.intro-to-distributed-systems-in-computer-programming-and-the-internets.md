## What is a distributed system? 

The way I think of distributed systems has a lot to do with virtual cloud providers like AWS and Google Cloud. Historically apps have been built with a single system like Ruby On Rails, Django, Laravel and other large Node.js, Java and Python apps. This works and still works, but at massive scale prevents new challenges to maintain fast application performance. Apps are hosted on web servers. Web servers can be hosted "in the cloud" on server farms maintained by private corporations. Whether your hardware was on premise or in the could a single application, how business was being done is called a "monolith" application.

In contrast to monolithic applications stand "microservices". Microservices are paid products by AWS and Google Cloud. 

Within the industry applications built in this way are "monoliths" or "modern monoliths". It's important to note there are some definite sales narritaves at play here by various companies and that this industry is dominated by monopoly power. In contrast to the monolithic application there's the distributed system.  In practice distributed systems for web development means buying up a lot of new technologies that major cloud service providers provide.

> For a straight up definition of distributed computing I recommend this free article [by educative](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-are-distributed-systems). Not being paid for the link, just seems legit. Plus, they have a course on Airflow for Python. It's paid; definitely cool they're building that product though. +1 for Educative ðŸ˜œ

> This [Free Code Camp article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-thorough-introduction-to-distributed-systems-3b91562c9b3c/) is also legit. Keep doing what you do free code camp! âœŠ power in community.

## Examples of distributed systems

These are some examples of distributed system technologies. 

- [Scuba](/assets/scuba-diving-into-data-at-facebook.pdf): a fast, scalable, distributed, in-memory database built at Facebook for web application performance monitoring.
- [MapReduce](/assets/mapreduce-whitepaper.pdf) from Google research for processing and generating large data sets.
- [Cassandra](/assets/cassandra.pdf) from Facebook research is a distributed storage system for managing very large amounts of structured data spread out across many commodity servers. 
- [Crypto networks](/assets/23-crypto-slides.pdf) for making networks secure and managing information. From the linked slides:

- [Kafka](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2019/apache-kafka-trillion-messages) for handling trillions of messages.

Distributed systems can be used to build powerful technology that handles insane amounts of information like Netflix, Uber and many major enterprises today. It's not easy to do and takes teams of engineers to run the data and the business at scale. Being able to work with distributed systems can be a game changer for businesses and is a sout after skill in the labor market.

## Ethics

- **Environmental considerations:** Running distibuted systems can use up tons of electricity. In the case of Bitcoin and proof of work this results in massive computer servers subsidized by coal fired power plants solving math problems for money. For more info see article: [Bitcoin is ruining the planet](https://thephoenix.substack.com/p/bitcoin-is-now-worth-50000-and-its). Be conscious about what programs you're running and the real world implications!

- **Concentrated corporate power:** There are only so many cloud service providers and companies that offer cloud services. The investment to host server farms and cutting edge technology at scale is huge. Amazon, Google and Microsoft are the major players in this space. They've bought up their competitors. Building distributed systems necessitates paying these corporate entities to host your application. At the beginning of this year the AWS team showed they're willing to pull their platform out from a company at will, in the case of Parler. There's net neutrality regulation but that does not extend to a cloud service provider like AWS (yet).


### How to scale database writes?
- sharding: sharding is hard.
- clustering (managed version): fully managed sharding. Your joins stay intact. Google Spanner. 
- publish subscribe


- [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/) for CDN










If you've worked with large codebases you may be familiar with tools like Datadog, New Relic or Elastic for Application Performance Monitoring (APM). These services are pretty amazing and help developers pinpoint problematic areas of their applications. You can drill down to see exactly what queries and requests are slow and create metrics to monitor the health of your application. APM systems are advanced but they're not new. More recently there's been a rise in developers building distributed systems. Distributed systems provide new challenges for monitoring and tracking a software system's health.
