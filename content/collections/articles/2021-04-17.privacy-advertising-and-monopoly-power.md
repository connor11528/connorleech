One of my latest guilty pleasures and something I like to nerd out about is concentrated corporate power and monopolies. I read some Marx and Che Guevara after college and I kind of see this as an extension of my poli sci degree tbh. Grapes of Wrath is one of my favorite books. Same with 1984 and most of Malcolm Gladwell :) My two favorites currently are [Goliath](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Goliath/Matt-Stoller/9781501182891), a history book by Matt Stoller and the direct to the point [Curse of Bigness](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780999745465) by National Economic Council appointee Tim Wu. 

I've compiled a list of companies that Google owns, these are pretty much off the top of my head. There's currently [antitrust suits against Google and FB](https://connorleech.info/blog/concentrated-corporate-power-democracy) with government striving to catch up to market action of the previous decades. 

Anywho, I'm stoked Statamic, what I use for this blog provides such stellar support for [AMP by Google](https://statamic.dev/amp) an initiative to basically host the free and open web on Google's servers. The latest straw is that Google is now using browser data from Chrome to sell advertising with an initiative called [Google FLoC](https://plausible.io/blog/google-floc).

It's something I like to geek out about ðŸ¤ª. And now for your moment of zen..
