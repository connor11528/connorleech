Last week the US Government launched an [antitrust lawsuit against Google](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1328941/download). There's also an ongoing [Congressional investigation](https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/competition_in_digital_markets.pdf) into Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple and the Digital Markets they control. No matter which way the Presidential election goes in November these executive and congressional actions are likely to press forward. The government is coming for big tech.

## The internet used to be an open network and information superhighway. Today it's run by corporate monopoly gatekeepers.

The lawsuit brought forth by the Justice Department is suing Google for anticompetitive and exclusionary business practices that violate the [Sherman Act](https://www.justice.gov/atr/competition-and-monopoly-single-firm-conduct-under-section-2-sherman-act-chapter-1). The Sherman Act was used to prosecute Microsoft in 2001 and broke up Standard Oil in 1911 and AT&T in 1982. If you've watched commercials on Hulu for more than five minutes you know AT&T is back together and more powerful than ever, controlling mobile phone networks, home internet and merging with the behmouth Time Warner for $85 billion in 2018. The Justice Deparment challenged this merger but it was ultimately able to go through. The Sherman Act, on the books since 1890, is important legislation to protect Americans from entrenched power and corporate interests. It doesn't solve all problems but in the case of the Google lawsuit it's being invoked in order to break up Google's control of the internet. Below are other notable Sherman Act cases with some companies you might recognize, pulled straight from Wikipedia :)

- **Standard Oil Co.** of New Jersey v. United States (1911), which broke up the company based on geography, and contributed to the Panic of 1910–11.
- United States v. **American Tobacco Co.** (1911), which split the company into four.
- United States v. **General Electric Co** (1911), where GE was judged to have violated the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, along with International General Electric, Philips, Sylvania, Tungsol, and Consolidated and Chicago Miniature. Corning and Westinghouse made consent decrees.[15]
- United States v. National City Lines (1953), related to the **General Motors** streetcar conspiracy.
- United States v. **AT&T Co.**, which was settled in 1982 and resulted in the breakup of the company.
- United States v. **Microsoft Corp.** was settled in 2001 without the breakup of the company.

The last major antitrust action by the US Government using the Sherman Act was against Microsoft around the turn of the century. Though this lawsuit did not break up the tech behmouth, they're still going strong today, it did prevent them from owning the internet. Most computers ran Microsoft's operating system. They had the Internet Explorer browser and were actively killing off their competitors. Without government action Microsoft could have owned everything.

After the government's case against Microsoft there was a flurry of innovation. Microsoft shared software plans with competitors. It did not crush new tech entrants like Google and Amazon, even though they owned the operating system and browser most people accessed the sites through. Prior to the lawsuit Microsoft point blank told Venture Capitalists to not invest in companies where Microsoft operated. After the suit Venture Capitalists poured bundreds of millions of dollars into new exciting ventures in part because they weren't afraid Microsoft would eat everything and everyone. Google, Facebook and Amazon rose in the innovative environment that was the wake of government action against Microsoft.

- 📺 I highly recommend watching [Halt and Catch Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halt_and_Catch_Fire_(TV_series)) if you're into this type of stuff. I found a legit [90s style history of the web](https://nostalgiacafe.proboards.com/thread/133/1990s-internet-world-wide-web) site in the course of researching this article.

- 📺 [Valley of the Boom](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7768092/) is another great series about the dawn of the internet.

## The U.S. Government's case againt Google

> Google of today is a monopoly gatekeeper for the internet, and one of the wealthiest companies on the planet, with a market value of $1 trillion and annual revenue exceeding $160 billion. For many years, Google has used anticompetitive tactics to maintain and extend its monopolies in the markets for general search services, search advertising, and general search text advertising—the cornerstones of its empire.

The Justice Department's case rests on Google's control of *search access points* to the internet, especially on mobile search. To be honest, this isn't news to anyone living or working in Silicon Valley, or anyone that uses the internet for that matter. Google owns internet and mobile search. Competing with Google in internet search is a fool's errand. Google pays Apple untold billions to be the default search option on iPhone. They have licensing and distribution agreements with manufacturerers and carriers to distribute hardware that uses Google as the default for internet search. Mobile phone providers that sell Android phones are strongly incentiviced to ship phones that have everything Google. Most people don't change the default search settings. The Justic Department argues that "Google has preset default status for an overwhelming share of the search access points on mobile devices sold in the United States". The original [PageRank algorithm](http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/422/1/1999-66.pdf) that set Google apart from other search engines in 1998 is old news but Google still owns search.

Google's created a self perpetuating flywheel where they use their power to control search, making them more powerful and better positioned to control more of the internet search and advertising markets. [Google has acquired 238 companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Alphabet) over the past 19 years for billions of dollars. They've bought YouTube, Looker for Big Data analytics, HTC for mobile phones, dozens of advertising companies, cloud technologies and gaming and social sites. Google has engineered the market so they dominate internet search. The Justice Department in conjunction with the States of Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, South Carolina and Texas have filed the lawsuit against Google for "unlawfully maintaining monopolies in the markets for general search services, search advertising, and general search text advertising in the United
States through anticompetitive and exclusionary practices".

The Justice Department backs up their case with revealing industry information and uses Google's own documents against them to outline the antitrust case. They've noticed that organic results on google have progressively shifted downward, making more room for sponsored, profitable Google links. Even by that point we realized and finding out about the Google search engine in all its nothingness. It was a bare screen when the alternatives weren't focused on search.

The case is led by [Attorney General William Barr](https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general), a Trump appointee, whose built a strong case to break up Google.

These passages are directly from the lawsuit filing:

- Google’s exclusionary agreements cover more than 80 percent of all U.S. search queries.

- Google requires Android device manufacturers that want to preinstall Google’s proprietary apps to sign an **anti-forking agreement**; these agreements set strict limits on the manufacturers’ ability to sell Android devices that do not comply with Google’s technical and design standards.

-  For Android device manufacturers that sign an anti-forking agreement,Google provides access to its vital proprietary apps and application program interfaces (APIs) for preinstallation, but only if the manufacturers contractually agree to (1) take **a bundle of other Google apps**, (2) make certain apps **undeletable**, and (3) **give Google the most valuable and important real estate on the default home screen**. 

- Google provides a share of its search advertising revenue to Android device manufacturers, mobile phone carriers, competing browsers, and Apple; in exchange, Google becomes the preset default general search engine for the most important search access points on a computer or mobile device. As a practical matter, users rarely switch the preset default general search engine. In many cases, the agreements relating to mobile devices go even further, expressly **prohibiting (1) the preinstallation of any rival general search services**, and (2) the setting of other defaults to rival general search engines. This means that **Google is the only preset default search provider preinstalled on the device**.

Google controls search access points to the internet through business dealings with device manufacturers and carriers, the mobile operating system and browsers it owns and corporate muscle. The Justice Department seeks to "restore competitive conditions in the markets affected by Google’s unlawful conduct". I think this means breaking Google up into separate copanies, but we'll see what happens.

## The internet is run by monopolies

Even in the course of writing this article I noticed I use Google search on an Apple laptop over AT&T's network. The sites that I visit in all likelihood run on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon's cloud or Google's Cloud. I use Google Chrome's browser. I went to buy a Chromebook and needed a Google account to sign into it. I'll judge the success of this post likely using Google Analytics and find my way home after a night out with Google Maps. We shop on Amazon and connect with each other through Facebook's properties like Instagram and Whatsapp. The Justice Department's lawsuit focuses on Google but now we're entering a new era of antitrust enforcement in the tech space. 

Today Congressman [David Cicilline](https://www.cicilline.com/) is part of the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives in Congress. He's Chairman of the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law and one of the key authors on Congress' publication on [Digital Markets](https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/competition_in_digital_markets.pdf). 

The Subcommittee examined the dominance of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google, and their business practices to determine how their power affects our economy and our democracy

These four corporations differ in important ways, studying their business practices has
revealed common problems.

The Congressional report identifies how today's internet monopolies Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google work:

1) each platform now serves as a gatekeeper over a key channel of distribution...  these giants can pick winners and losers throughout our economy
- exorbitant fees
- oppressive contract terms
- extracting valuable data from the people and businesses that rely on them

2)  each platform uses its gatekeeper position to maintain its market power
- surveilled other businesses to identify potential rivals and have ultimately bought out, copied, or cut off their competitive threats

3) abused their role as intermediaries to further entrench and expand their dominance
- self-preferencing
- predatory pricing
- exclusionary conduct
- the dominant platforms have exploited their power in order to become even more dominant

The report comes out and states what most people working in tech already know:

> To put it simply, companies that once were scrappy, underdog startups that challenged the status quo have become the kinds of monopolies we last saw in the era of oil barons and railroad tycoons.

## The Environment
  
Up until recently it was politically pretty fringe to want to break up American corporations. Income inequality has been rising. Thoughts about political economy and Americans being a nation of producers instead of consumers have been warpped since the 1970s and the rise of neoliberalism and the Chicago School of Economics. Tech started scrappy and now is Goliath. Texas Congressman [Wright Patman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_Patman) was a vehement trust buster and restrainer of Wall Street. 
  
- 📺 [Saving Capitalism](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6185286/) is a documentary by [Robert Reich](https://robertreich.org/) that highlights how inequality in the United States works from an economic and political perspective. 

  
## American History 

  
[Louis Brandeis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Brandeis) was an American Supreme Court Justice from 1916 to 1939. He was from Kentucky. In 1890 Brandeis wrote an article in Harvard Business Review (ya it was around way back then) called [The Right to Privacy](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~shmat/courses/cs5436/warren-brandeis.pdf) that articulated Americans have a right to be left alone. That's fucking mind boggling that individual privacy and monopoly power . He wrote a book called [Other People's Money and How the Bankers Use It](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1125344.Other_People_s_Money_and_How_the_Bankers_Use_It) which sounds like a great name for a Netflix sitcom if you ask me.. Brandeis saw giant companies capable of dominating whole industries.
