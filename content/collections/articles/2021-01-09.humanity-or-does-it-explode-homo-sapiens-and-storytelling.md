The genus Homo has been around for 2.5 million years. Homo Sapiens have been around for about 200,000 years. All other species of our genus are extinct. The Neanderthals had been around for about 300,000 years before Homo Sapiens evolved, then went extinct 30,000 years ago. Homo rudolfensis, Homo erectus and Homo Denisova were other breeds of human that have all gone extinct. The only genetic record of these species alive totally is a little bit of Neanderthal DNA that is part of the Homo Sapien genome. A project a few years ago sequenced the Neanderthal genome.

Genetics is complicated, I'm more interested in the timeline and climate change today.

Homo Homo Sapiens first evolved in East Africa
