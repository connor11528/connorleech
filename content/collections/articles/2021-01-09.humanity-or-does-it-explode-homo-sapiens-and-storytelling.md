Humans, homo sapiens our unique genus and species is remarkably different from any other creature on Earth. We cross oceans and setup limited liability corporations, tame animals and breed crops. We've altered the climate of the planet through our activities. We've altered the ecology and escaped the food chain. All these things happened because something flipped genetically in homo sapiens, giving us the ability to tell stories. This development set up the sixth extinction event in the history of the earth. Mass extinction of the earth's species has been happening since homo sapiens left East Africa and the process continues unabated every year. Rapid climate change breeds species extinction. Human storytelling is what sets us apart from the food chain; it's also the cause of climate change and mass extinction. In this lighthearted spirit we'll dive into the history of our species and planet Earth up to the present day. Buckle up.

So Earth is hella fucking old. Here's a timeline of some notable events we'll explore more in the next section:

- **3.5 billion years ago:** Earlist known life on earth.
- **335 million years ago**: Giant landmass called Pangea formed. All continents are "together as one"™
- **210 million years ago**: First mammals
- **245 - 66 million years ago**: Dinosaurs 🦕 This time is called the Mesozoic Era, it's  further broken into the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods.
- **175 million years ago:** Pangea begins to break apart 
- **66 million years ago:** Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-T) extinction event. Asteroid hit earth eliminating 80% of all species.
- **55 million years ago:** First monkeys 🐵
- **30 million years ago** Modern continents pretty much formed. 🗺️
- **6 million years ago:** Last common ancestor between humans and chimpanzees 💔
- **2.5 million years ago:** Genus Homo comes into existence, uses stone tools ⛏️
- **2 million years ago:** Genus Homo spreads from Africa to Europe and Asia. Different species within the genus Homo evolve. 🐒
- **500,000 years ago:** First Neanderthals
- **300,000 years ago:** Genus Homo is using fire on a regular basis 🔥
- **200,000 years ago:** First Homo Sapiens evolve in East Africa 💪
- **100,000 years ago:** Homo erectus goes extinct ❌
- **70,000 years ago:** Cognitive Revolution 💡
- **70,000 years ago:** Homo denisova goes extinct ❌
- **45,000 years ago:** Homo Sapiens settle Australia 🇦🇺. Australian megafauna extinct ❌
- **40,000 years ago:** Homo Sapiens settle Europe 🇪🇺. Neanderthals go extinct ❌
- **16,000 years ago:** Homo Sapiens settle Americas 🇺🇸. American megafauna go extinct ❌
- **13,000 years ago:** Last different species from us in our genus (Homo Floresiensis) goes extict ❌
- **12,000 years ago:** Agricultural Revolution 🌾
- **500 years ago:** Scientific Revolution 🔭
- **200 years ago:** Industrial Revolution 🏭

Homo denisova and Neanderthals interbred with modern humans.


The genus Homo has been around for 2.5 million years. Homo Sapiens have been around for about 200,000 years. All other species of our genus are extinct. The Neanderthals had been around for about 300,000 years before Homo Sapiens evolved, then went extinct 30,000 years ago. Homo rudolfensis, Homo erectus and Homo Denisova were other breeds of human that have all gone extinct. The only genetic record of these species alive today is a little bit of Neanderthal DNA that is part of the Homo Sapien genome. A project a few years ago sequenced the Neanderthal genome.

Genetics is complicated, I'm more interested in the timeline and climate change today.

Homo Homo Sapiens first evolved in East Africa
