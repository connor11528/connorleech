We recently had our second baby girl at the UC San Francisco Benioff children's hospital. Being present to watch the baby being born was truly a blessing. The hospital staff works very hard, seemed to be a great team and went above and beyond to care for us and make us feel as comfortable as possible. Our baby, now only a few days old is healthy and my wife is recovering. I've got nothing but praise for the hospital staff and the organization. Spending a few days in the hospital though did get me thinking about medical insurance, healthcare in America and the hospital bed industry.

With a new baby in our house I'm not getting any sleep anyway so here we go..

## Healthcare costs bankrupt, terrify, coerce and bully millions of Americans

Spending days in the hospital can bankrupt anyone in America, besides maybe Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos or others in the richest .1% of the country. Millions of Americans are uninsured, which to me is unfathomable. A trip to the hospital or doing something human like having a baby would surely bankrupt anyone who's uninsured in this country. Illness or medical bills contributes to over 60% of all bankruptcies in the United States. Getting sick in America is probably one of the fastest roads to financial ruin.

I hate to say it but how fucked up healthcare is in America seems to be pretty common knowledge. People fight about how to fix healthcare but no one disputes there are some pretty fundamental problems. It's intimidating to even think about fixing healthcare because the problems seem so enormous, the players so large and the opinions so strongly held. Most people myself included won't really take the time to learn about the healthcare industry in America until we're forced into it, whether in sickness or in health. The best course of action seems to be to pay for insurance and pray. Stay healthy.. ðŸ’ª It's not great but let's hope our politicians can figure it out and hope we don't get screwed in the meantime.
