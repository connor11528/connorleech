Do we live in the best of all possible worlds or could this world be better? I think how you answer this question determines your outlook on political economic problems today. Over the past forty two years the American political discussion has shifted to a discussion between the "haves" and "have nots" to a discussion between the "haves" and the "haves". The very idea of "political economy" seems to be replaced by banks that solicit goernment to bail them out. Economics is for specialists; the only cries in the alternative are somewhat lazy "capitalism is broken" calls. Inequality, student debt, unemployment and healthcare are straight up ridiculous and terrifying. There's something brewing in the alternative and it needs a political voice. 

In 1978 Robert Bork published a paper called "The Antitrust Paradox" that rewrote history. In that legal paper Bork, a lawyer that President Ronald Regean later nominated to the Supreme Court, argued Congress didn't mean to protect American freedoms from rule by corporations when it passed the Sherman Act of 1890. It's a convienent argument for his radical positions that changed the shape of American politics. Bork argued that when Congress passed the Sherman Act (88 years before his paper was written) they only meant to protect consumers. That in fact the only goal of the Sherman Act was to potect "consumer welfare". In Brok's view if it doesn't hurt consumers then there's no antitrust violation.

The fact is that antitrust legislation was passed to protect against violations that today rule our everyday lives.

in 1890 when it passed the Sherman Act. It's the most cited book on antitrust because it protects the corporation.

This is a pretty fundamental question for anybody and any field but today I'd like to discuss how it relates to political economy in the United States. There's the laisez faire view that the market's always right. This thought is embraced by Libertarians. We live in the best of all possible worlds and any intervention by the government into the world of business, let alone the tech business is bound to mess it all up. The Libertarian view subscribes that the ills in the world it's due to too much government. That's the libertarian view and there's a strong current running for it in Silicon Valley. This post is
