Ah the coding interview. Have you cracked it yet? Do you know how to invert a binary tree? Fear not. With dedication you can study to do all of these things. Here is one of many resources, a resource of resources if you will about preparing for software engineer interviews.

- [Outco](https://www.outco.io/): this is a more or less full time program for a month. I've found it helpful so far; I'm still in the program :)


- **Employbl:** is a program I'm working on with a small but mighty team. The idea is to help candidates organize their job hunt by providing better access to information, powered by the free and open internet. We have a blog post explaining that there are [2 types of software engineer interviews](https://www.employbl.com/blog/2-types-of-software-engineer-interviews) (opinion).


- [AlgoExpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/questions): 135+ questions and video recorded walkthrough answers, built by an ex Googler. This is a paid product that's pretty awesome imho.


- I've collected some other resources as an [open source list on GitHub](https://github.com/connor11528/cs-fundamentals). Pull requests welcome ;)
