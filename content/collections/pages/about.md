Hi my name's Connor. I work as a Full Stack Developer at [Phone2Action](https://phone2action.com/) where I work with PHP, Laravel, SQL and Javascript. I live in scenic Alameda, CA near Oakland and San Francisco in the United States of America ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸. I've built and launched [Employbl](https://www.employbl.com/), [epiclaravel.dev](https://epiclaravel.dev/) and [Linemans Milestones](http://www.linemansmilestones.com/#/) along with dozens of open source projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/connor11528). Previously I worked as an agency technical recruiter and briefly as a door to door fundraiser raising money for Children International. I'm a father of two and husband to one :)

I grew up in Marin County, the north part of the Bay Area and graduated from UC Santa Barbara with a degree in Political Science. I learned to code after college and am fortunate to have traveled to eighteen countries so far.
