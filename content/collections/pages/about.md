Hi my name's Connor. I work as a Full Stack Developer with PHP, Laravel, SQL and Javascript. I live in scenic Alameda, CA near Oakland and San Francisco ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸. In previous lifes I was an agency technical recruiter and a door to door fundraiser (salesperson). I'm Olive's Dad and Victoria's husband

I'm originally from Marin County, northern part of the Bay Area and graduated from UC Santa Barbara with a degree in Political Science. I learned to code after college and am fortunate to have traveled to eighteen countries so far.
