Hi my name's Connor. I work as a full stack software developer building for the web. I live in San Francisco. In previous lives I was an agency technical recruiter and a door to door fundraiser. I'm Olive and Poppy's Dad and Victoria's husband

I'm originally from Marin County, northern part of the Bay Area and graduated from UC Santa Barbara with a degree in Political Science. I learned to code after college and am fortunate to have traveled to eighteen countries so far.

This is my LinkedIn bio:

> Hi Iâ€™m Connor ðŸ‘‹. I currently work full time for CommentSold, the #1 live selling platform, as a Software Engineer building primarily in Laravel, PHP and Javascript. I used these technologies at previous companies too and feel well versed in them in addition to SQL and Vue.js.

> As a side project I build and run a website called [Employbl](https://www.employbl.com/) that illuminates trends in the tech industry for job seekers. Weâ€™ve collected data on over 11,000 companies, 26,000 fundraising rounds and currently have 60k active job listings in the system. I regularly share insights from the data on this website :)

> Iâ€™m learning more Python, data analysis and modern JS frameworks this year, as well as strategies for writing cleaner code. I like spending time with my family and outdoors.
