Hi my name's Connor. I work as a full stack software developer building for the web. I live in scenic Alameda, CA near Oakland and San Francisco 🇺🇸. In previous lives I was an agency technical recruiter and a door to door fundraiser. I'm Olive's Dad and Victoria's husband

I'm originally from Marin County, northern part of the Bay Area and graduated from UC Santa Barbara with a degree in Political Science. I learned to code after college and am fortunate to have traveled to eighteen countries so far.
